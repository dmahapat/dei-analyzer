## Policy Alignment — RAG Analysis

### Finding 1 🔴 [HIGH]

**Audit department shows a 5.5-year tenure gap (Male avg > Female avg)**

> **Handbook Reference 1:** India Office DEI Focus Areas: - Increase women's representation in IT and Consulting departments at mid-senior levels (currently ~28%, target 40% by 2027). - Reduce attrition among women associates in years 3-5 of tenure. - Ensure equitable access to global client-facing projects for India-based associates. - Close the promotion-rate gap between India and US offices.

> **Handbook Reference 2:** Membership: Open to all associates. Active membership: ~620 across all offices. Gender Representation Targets (firm-wide): - Partner level: 30% women by 2027 (current: 24%) - Director level: 40% women by 2027 (current: 35%) - Manager level: 50% women by 2027 (current: 47%) ............................................................................ 3.5 APARAJITA — South Asian & India Office BRG …

> **Handbook Reference 3:** - Regional Festival Celebrations: Firm-recognized observances of Diwali, Holi, Pongal, Eid, Onam, and other regional festivals with office events and floating holiday options. - Gender Equity in India Offices: Focused programming on women's advancement in the India offices, including women-in-tech mentoring, safety and transportation support for late shifts, and childcare stipend advocacy. - La …

➜ **Verdict:** The tenure disparity in Audit signals higher female attrition or later hiring. This conflicts with [Aparajita BRG (Section 3.5)] which commits to 'reduce attrition among women associates in years 3-5 of tenure' and ensure equitable retention across the India office.

### Finding 8 🔴 [HIGH]

**Severe pipeline narrowing: 63.0% female at Associate level drops to 12.5% at Director level**

> **Handbook Reference 1:** 3. Inclusive Promotion Practices — We will review promotion and succession planning processes annually for bias, using both quantitative analysis and associate feedback. 4. Leadership Accountability — Every partner and director will include DEI objectives in their annual performance goals. Progress on these goals will factor into compensation decisions.

> **Handbook Reference 2:** Key Initiatives: - Women in Leadership Accelerator: 12-month cohort program for high-potential senior managers and directors, including executive coaching, board-readiness training, and sponsor matching. - Flexible Work Advocacy: Partnered with firm leadership to design equitable flexible-work policies that do not penalize associates in promotion or compensation decisions. - Pay Equity Champion …

➜ **Verdict:** The steep drop-off in female representation across job levels indicates systemic advancement barriers. This directly contradicts [DEI Governance (Section 4), Inclusive Promotion Practices (CEO Pledge #3)] — the CEO pledges annual bias reviews of promotion processes and the WoW BRG runs a Leadership Accelerator program to address exactly this pattern.
