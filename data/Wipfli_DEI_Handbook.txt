================================================================================

Last Updated: January 2026
Classification: Internal — All Associates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSION & VISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Wipfli, we believe that diverse perspectives fuel better ideas, stronger
client outcomes, and a more vibrant workplace. Our mission is to cultivate an
environment where every associate — regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, ability, veteran status, or background — feels valued, heard, and
empowered to reach their full potential.

Our DEI Vision Statement:
"To be a firm where belonging is not aspirational but operational — embedded in
how we hire, develop, promote, and serve."

Core DEI Principles:
  - Equity of Opportunity: Every associate has fair access to mentorship,
    stretch assignments, and advancement pathways.
  - Inclusive Leadership: Leaders are accountable for creating psychologically
    safe teams where dissent and diverse viewpoints are welcomed.
  - Data-Driven Progress: We measure representation, pay equity, promotion
    rates, and engagement scores across demographics and hold ourselves
    accountable to published targets.
  - Community Impact: Our commitment extends beyond our walls — we invest in
    diverse talent pipelines, pro-bono DEI consulting, and community grants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. CEO PLEDGE ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"As CEO of Wipfli, I pledge that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not
peripheral programs — they are central to our strategy, our values, and our
future.

I commit to the following:

  1. Transparent Reporting — We will publish annual demographic data on
     representation at every level of the firm, including partner and
     leadership ranks, broken down by gender, ethnicity, and veteran status.

  2. Pay Equity Audits — We will conduct annual third-party pay equity analyses
     and close any statistically significant gaps within 12 months of
     identification.

  3. Inclusive Promotion Practices — We will review promotion and succession
     planning processes annually for bias, using both quantitative analysis
     and associate feedback.

  4. Leadership Accountability — Every partner and director will include DEI
     objectives in their annual performance goals. Progress on these goals
     will factor into compensation decisions.

  5. Investment in BRGs — We will fund and empower our Business Resource Groups
     with dedicated budgets, executive sponsors, and direct channels to
     firm leadership.

  6. Supplier Diversity — We will increase spending with diverse-owned vendors
     by 15% year-over-year and track progress quarterly.

  7. Anti-Harassment Zero Tolerance — We will maintain a zero-tolerance policy
     on harassment and discrimination, with independent investigation
     processes and protection against retaliation.

This is not a one-time statement. I will revisit these commitments publicly
each year and report on what we achieved, where we fell short, and what we
will do next."

— CEO, Wipfli LLP
